# FIX-2: Candle Version Conflict Resolution

## Issue Summary
The root `Cargo.toml` workspace definition had a version conflict:
- **Root workspace.dependencies**: Used candle 0.9.1 from git
- **Package usage** (e.g., niodoo-core): Expected candle 0.8 from crates.io

This mismatch could cause dependency resolution conflicts and build failures.

## Root Cause
The `[workspace.dependencies]` section in `/Niodoo-Final/Cargo.toml` specified:
```toml
candle-core = { git = "https://github.com/huggingface/candle", version = "0.9.1" }
candle-nn = { git = "https://github.com/huggingface/candle", version = "0.9.1" }
candle-transformers = { git = "https://github.com/huggingface/candle", version = "0.9.1" }
```

This forced packages using `{ workspace = true }` to depend on the 0.9.1 git version, creating a mismatch with the 0.8 crates.io expectation.

## Resolution

### Changes Made
**File: `/home/beelink/Niodoo-Final/Cargo.toml` (lines 64-67)**

**Before:**
```toml
# Candle framework for ML operations
candle-core = { git = "https://github.com/huggingface/candle", version = "0.9.1" }
candle-nn = { git = "https://github.com/huggingface/candle", version = "0.9.1" }
candle-transformers = { git = "https://github.com/huggingface/candle", version = "0.9.1" }
```

**After:**
```toml
# Candle framework for ML operations
candle-core = { version = "0.8" }
candle-nn = { version = "0.8" }
candle-transformers = { version = "0.8" }
```

### Details
- ✅ Removed git source references (`git = "https://github.com/huggingface/candle"`)
- ✅ Changed version from 0.9.1 to 0.8
- ✅ Standardized all candle packages to version 0.8
- ✅ Dependencies now resolve from crates.io instead of git

## Impact
- **Consistency**: All workspace members now use consistent candle 0.8 from crates.io
- **Build Reliability**: Eliminates git dependency issues and speeds up builds
- **Package Packages Affected**:
  - niodoo-core
  - tcs-ml
  - Any other workspace member using candle dependencies

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Updated workspace.dependencies in root Cargo.toml
2. ✅ Removed all git source references
3. ✅ Confirmed packages use `{ workspace = true }` for candle deps

## Notes
- This fix aligns the workspace with the actual crates.io version 0.8
- Users can run `cargo update` to refresh lock file with new version
- The candle-transformers package was also updated to 0.8 for consistency
