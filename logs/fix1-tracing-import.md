# FIX-1: Tracing Import Verification Report

## Task Description
Add missing tracing import to `niodoo_real_integrated/src/pipeline.rs` and verify that the `warn!` macro compiles.

## Status: ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE

### Import Check
**Location:** `niodoo_real_integrated/src/pipeline.rs:24`

```rust
use tracing::warn;
```

The required import is **already present** in the file.

### warn! Macro Usage
**Location:** `niodoo_real_integrated/src/pipeline.rs:115`

```rust
warn!(?error, "vLLM warmup failed");
```

The `warn!` macro is correctly used with structured logging syntax.

### Compilation Status
**Result:** ❌ Does NOT compile

The file has compilation errors, but they are **NOT related** to the tracing import:

1. **Error 1 (Line 176):** Type mismatch - `CompassEngine::evaluate` requires `&mut self` but receives `&CompassEngine`
2. **Error 2 (Line 178):** `tokio::task::JoinHandle` is not an iterator - needs `FutureExt` trait
3. **Error 3 (Line 172):** Type annotations needed in `tokio::try_join!` macro

### Conclusion
- ✅ The `use tracing::warn;` import is correctly present
- ✅ The `warn!` macro at line 115 is syntactically correct
- ❌ The file does NOT compile due to unrelated type system errors in the `process_prompt` method

The tracing import requirement is satisfied. Compilation failures are due to separate issues in the async/parallel processing logic.
