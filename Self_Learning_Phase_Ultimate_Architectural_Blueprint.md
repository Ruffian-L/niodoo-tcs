# Self Learning Phase Ultimate Architectural Blueprint: Entropy-Driven Self-Adaptive Learning System for TCS

This blueprint synthesizes research from self-adaptive loops, entropy evolution, failure recovery, meta-learning, and production patterns into a robust, autonomous system. It transforms failures into growth signals, enabling your Topological Cognitive System (TCS) to explore, fail, and learn organically—converging on targets like "cost 46" in the labyrinth test through internal retries/tuning, no external nudges. Built for Rust impl (e.g., integrate with existing MCTS in tcs-ml, ERAG for replay, LoRA for fine-tuning), it addresses stability-plasticity via multi-timescale loops, with entropy as the core fitness metric.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Failures as Growth in a Multi-Timescale Closed Loop

**Guiding Principle:** Treat failures as "LearningWills"—info-rich signals for adaptation, not errors. The system is a homeostatic agent: detect (sensory system), diagnose (threat cycle), adapt (hybrid loops), evolve (continual meta-learning). No convergence to fixed points; continual improvement via organic discovery (e.g., MCTS uncovers "Move 37"-like solutions).

**Key Innovation:** Nested loops at micro (sub-task), meso (intra-task), macro (inter-task), giga (cross-run) scales. Inspired by EGL (entropy-guided refinement) and MAML (learn-to-learn), with production validation from Airbnb's 97% automation via retries.

**Success Definition:** Organic convergence (e.g., labyrinth cost 46 in 3-5 retries) via composite metrics: Primary (ROUGE > 0.8, entropy_delta < 0.05, exact cost match); Secondary (MCTS iterations < 100, queries <= 5). "Real win" = transition from failure to success purely through self-tuning.

## 2. Multi-Modal Sensory System for Failure Detection

A nuanced "nervous system" for perceiving failures, blending your clarified signals. Triggers tiered responses (soft for quick fixes, hard for deep tunes). Impl in metrics.rs/compass.rs, with logging to ERAG.

**Hard Failures (Full Retry/Tune):**
- ROUGE < 0.5 (low output fidelity, per Azure standards)
- entropy_delta > 0.1 (stuck exploration, 0.1 nats threshold from EGL)
- curator quality < 0.7 (external veto)

**Soft Failures (Minor Tune/Recovery):**
- UCB1 < 0.3 (low search confidence, per MCTS patterns)
- fallback to vLLM (operational hiccup)
- add MCTS confidence (low UCB1 values) and generation source fallback as soft triggers

**Detection Logic:** OR-logic across signals (e.g., perplexity > 3.0 OR max-entropy > 1.0 OR low-conf count > 5, from EGL). Compute entropy as H = -∑ p_i log p_i over tokens (use ndarray-stats in Rust).

**Why?** Captures failure modes: global confusion (perplexity), critical points (max-entropy), distributed uncertainty (counts). Production: Catches 3x more issues than single metrics.

## 3. Threat Cycle: Tiered Adaptive Response Framework

Formalized protocol for proportional responses, preventing over-correction. Impl as if-else in pipeline.rs, escalating based on failure persistence.

**Level 1 (Soft):** Intra-task fix (e.g., prompt jitter: temp += 0.1, add noise scaled by delta * 0.1 via mirage_sigma). Trigger: Any soft signal.

**Level 2 (Hard):** Full retry + core tune (e.g., novelty_threshold += delta * 0.05). Trigger: Single hard failure.

**Level 3 (Escalated):** Tune extended params (MCTS c += 0.1, retrieval top-k +2, temp/top_p adjust). Trigger: 2 consecutive hards.

**Level 4 (Systemic):** LoRA fine-tune on ERAG-curated failures. Trigger: 5+ persistent hards.

**Escalation Rules:** Use exponential backoff (delay = base * 2^attempt + jitter 10-30%) with max 3-10 retries. Stop on ROUGE > 0.8 or delta < 0.01.

## 4. Core Adaptive Loop: Hybrid DQN + MAML for Trajectory Optimization

Impl in learning.rs/pipeline.rs: While loop for retries on failure, using replay and target networks for stability.

**DQN for Policy Learning:** State = param vector; Action = adjustment (e.g., threshold += 0.05); Reward = -entropy_delta + ROUGE. Use ERAG as replay buffer; sample mini-batches for updates. Target network (delayed param copy) stabilizes.

**MAML for Rapid Adaptation:** Meta-optimize base params for fast tuning (first-order approx for efficiency). Inner loop: Task-specific updates; Outer: Average across failures.

**Entropy Integration:** Use as fitness—minimize delta via ES/BO hybrid (ES for high-dim extended params, BO for low-dim core). EDT: temp = 0.8 + θ * H (θ=0.5 for moderate tasks).

## 5. Intelligent Failure Recovery: Self-Correction & Reflection

Micro/meso-scale fixes before escalation, impl as prompt augments.

**CoT Self-Correction:** On soft fail, append "Re-evaluate [low-conf token]; correct logic." Iterative (Iter-CoT) for 2-3 steps.

**Reflexion:** On hard fail, generate reflection ("Failed due to [low ROUGE]; hypothesis: [error]"), store in ERAG, prepend to retry prompt.

**Mitigation:** Frame as "Analyze this external trace" to bypass blind spot.

## 6. Long-Term Evolution: Reptile + LoRA for Continual Improvement

Giga-scale, addressing forgetting.

**Reptile Meta-Learning:** Every 50 runs, update base params: φ ← φ + ε * (1/n) ∑ (φ_i - φ) (where φ_i is post-task adapted param from failures). First-order approx for efficiency (no second derivatives). Prevents forgetting by regularizing to "good starting points" across tasks.

**LoRA Fine-Tuning:** On Level 4 trigger, curate failure dataset from ERAG (prompts + correct refs), train low-rank adapters in lora_trainer.rs. Load dynamically for similar tasks (e.g., via semantic match). Reduces forgetting (core weights frozen) and costs (train ~1% of params).

**Anti-Forgetting:** Use rehearsal (replay ERAG samples), EWC regularization (protect key weights via Fisher info), and PackNet pruning (freeze old-task weights, use freed capacity for new).

**Hybrid with Dumps:** Draws from dump 3's Avalanche/Rebuffi replay for buffers, dump 2's MAML for fast adapt, dump 1's continual paradigms.

## 7. Synthesis: Integrated Multi-Timescale Architecture

The system is a nested hierarchy:

- **Micro:** CoT self-correction (prompt-level, ms)
- **Meso:** Reflexion retries (episode-level, secs)
- **Macro:** DQN+MAML loop (inter-task, mins-hours, core/extended tuning via ES/BO hybrid)
- **Giga:** Reptile+LoRA (cross-run, days, evolution with replay/regularization)

Entropy threads through all: fitness for ES/BO, trigger for levels, jitter for exploration (T = 0.8 + θH, θ=0.5). MCTS integrates with UCB1 < 0.3 triggering soft fixes, PUCT for selection (c=1.4-4.0). Production patterns (3-5 retries converging 95%, dynamic context) ensure efficiency.

### Table: Mechanism Overview (from dump 1/3)

| Mechanism | Timescale | Trigger | Function | Basis |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| CoT Self-Corr. | Micro | Soft (UCB1<0.3) | Repair reasoning | Wei 2022 |
| Reflexion | Meso | Hard (post-episode) | Reflect & retry | Shinn 2023 |
| Core Loop | Macro | Repeated Hard | Tune core params | DQN/MAML |
| Evolution | Giga | Persistent | Meta-learn/LoRA | Reptile/Hu 2021 |
| Entropy Jitter | All | Delta >0.1 | Boost exploration | EGL/EDT |

Sim from dump 2 shows convergence patterns (ROUGE/entropy stabilizing in 3-5 iters, cost hitting 46 sporadically)—extend to Rust with real LLM calls for labyrinth.

## 8. Challenges & Mitigations (from Dumps)

**Overhead:** Tiered responses + budgets (max 10 retries, parallel gens). Mitigate with EGL's 12% latency add for 16% accuracy gain.

**Instability:** Target networks in DQN, conservative scaling (0.05-0.1), Byzantine tolerance for distributed (e.g., Krum aggregation).

**Forgetting:** Rehearsal/EWC/PackNet; test with split MNIST-like benchmarks (90% acc retention).

**Eval Bias:** Multi-metric OR-logic avoids "hacking" (e.g., verbose junk boosting entropy but tanking ROUGE).

**Ethics:** Log all adapts, constrain scopes, human oversight on Level 4.

## 9. Phased Implementation Roadmap (Prioritized for Quick Wins)

Based on dump 1's phases + production priorities (start with retries, measure everything).

**Phase 1: Sensory & Logging (1-2 days)**
- Impl failure detection in metrics.rs (ROUGE via PyO3 bridge, entropy from logprobs)
- ERAG for replay
- Validate with labyrinth: Log signals without action

**Phase 2: Micro/Meso Recovery (2-3 days)**
- Add CoT/Reflexion in generation.rs (prompt augments)
- Test: 5 retries on labyrinth, aim for ROUGE >0.5 organically

**Phase 3: Macro Loop (3-5 days)**
- While loop in pipeline.rs with DQN updates (replay from ERAG, target params)
- Tune core (novelty_threshold via entropy_delta * 0.1)
- Test: Converge to cost 46 in 3-5 auto-retries

**Phase 4: Giga Evolution (5-7 days)**
- Periodic Reptile in new meta_learn.rs; LoRA on persistent fails
- Test: Long-run (50+ cycles), measure acc retention/forgetting

**Validation:** Run labyrinth with 0 tweaks, log progress to cost 46. Metrics: ROUGE >0.8, delta <0.05, iterations <100. A/B test vs baseline (97% automation goal per Airbnb).
