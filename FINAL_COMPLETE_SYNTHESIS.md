## ❌ WHAT'S MISSING (CRITICAL GAPS)

### 🔴 CRITICAL #1: Curator Not Integrated

**Problem**: Memories stored RAW without quality analysis

**Current Flow**:
```
User Input → Pipeline → Generation → ❌ RAW RESPONSE → Qdrant
```

**Needed Flow**:
```
User Input → Pipeline → Generation → Curator → ✅ REFINED RESPONSE → Qdrant
```

**Impact**: Low-quality memories polluting Qdrant database

**Fix Required**: Add curator stage between generation and storage in `niodoo_real_integrated/src/pipeline.rs`

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL #2: Visualization Disconnected

**Problem**: Visualization systems exist but never called from pipeline

**Impact**: No real-time feedback during processing

**Fix Required**: Add viz bridge calls to `niodoo_real_integrated/src/pipeline.rs`

---

### 🟡 HIGH #3: GPU Acceleration Not Used

**Problem**: GPU code exists but not integrated into production pipeline

**Impact**: Slower processing than possible

**Fix Required**: Use GPU for embeddings in `niodoo_real_integrated/src/embedding.rs`

---

### 🟡 HIGH #4: Python Backend Separate

**Problem**: EchoMemoria runs independently, not called from Rust pipeline

**Impact**: Advanced processing capabilities not utilized

**Fix Required**: Add HTTP client to call EchoMemoria from pipeline

---

### 🟢 MEDIUM #5: Multiple Orchestrators Confusion

**Problem**: 4 different orchestrators doing similar things

**Impact**: Confusion about which to use, duplicate functionality

**Fix Required**: Consolidate into single master orchestrator with clear hierarchy
