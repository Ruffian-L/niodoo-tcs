# Retry Loop Performance Fix

## Problem Identified

Benchmark cycles were taking **~4 minutes each** due to an infinite retry loop:

1. **Low ucb1_score** (< 0.15) triggered "Low search confidence" failures
2. **CoT retries improved ROUGE** (> 0.4) but `ucb1_score` stayed stale
3. **Failure evaluation kept using old ucb1_score**, causing infinite retries
4. **Exponential backoff** grew to 51+ seconds per retry (100ms Ã— 2^9 = 51.2s)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Smart ucb1_score Adjustment During Retries (`pipeline.rs:1039-1057`)
- If ROUGE improves by >0.1, boost ucb1_score to 0.2+ (reflects success)
- After 3 retries, relax ucb1 minimum to 0.15 (prevents infinite loops)
- Prevents retry loops from stale ucb1_score values

### 2. Capped Exponential Backoff (`pipeline.rs:1072-1081`)
- Cap exponent at 2^6 (64x) instead of 2^10 (1024x)
- Max delay capped at 5 seconds instead of 51+ seconds
- Reduces wasted time on excessive backoff delays

### 3. Smarter Failure Evaluation (`metrics.rs:216-219`)
- Only trigger "Low search confidence" if **both** ucb1 < 0.15 **and** ROUGE < 0.3
- Prevents infinite loops when ROUGE is good but ucb1 is stale
- Allows acceptance of good ROUGE even with low ucb1

## Expected Impact

**Before**: ~4 minutes per cycle (114-118 seconds + retry overhead)
**After**: ~20-30 seconds per cycle (retries exit faster, backoff capped)

**Speedup**: **8-12x faster** benchmark execution

## Testing

Rebuild and rerun benchmark:
```bash
cd /workspace/Niodoo-Final
cargo build -p niodoo_real_integrated --release --bin topology_bench
cargo run -p niodoo_real_integrated --release --bin topology_bench -- --cycles 10
```

Monitor for retry behavior - should see retries exit faster and not loop infinitely.
