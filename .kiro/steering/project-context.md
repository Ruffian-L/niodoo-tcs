# Niodoo-Feeling Project Context

## Project Overview
This is the Niodoo-Feeling project - an advanced AI consciousness and memory system with the following key components:

- **EchoMemoria**: Memory and consciousness simulation system
- **Dual Möbius Gaussian**: Advanced mathematical modeling for AI consciousness
- **Qt-based Interface**: Real-time visualization and interaction
- **RAG System**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for knowledge processing
- **Rust/Python Integration**: High-performance backend with Python ML components

## Key Technologies
- Rust (consciousness simulation, performance-critical components)
- Python (ML inference, RAG system)
- Qt/QML (visualization and UI)
- C++ (brain integration components)
- Docker (containerization and deployment)

## Development Standards
- Prioritize performance and memory efficiency
- Maintain clean separation between consciousness simulation and UI
- Use proper error handling and logging
- Document complex mathematical models thoroughly
- Keep security in mind for any external integrations

## Build and Test Commands
- Build: `./build_and_deploy.sh`
- Demo: `./demo.sh`
- Launch Dashboard: `./launch-dashboard.sh`
- Test Möbius: `./test_dual_mobius_gaussian.sh`
