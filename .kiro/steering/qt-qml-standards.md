# Qt/QML Standards for Niodoo-Feeling

## Real-time Visualization
- Maintain 60fps for consciousness visualization components
- Use efficient property bindings for data updates
- Implement proper cleanup for animation resources
- Handle large datasets with virtual models when needed

## Consciousness Interface Design
- Visual representations should reflect mathematical model states
- Use smooth transitions for consciousness state changes
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- Provide clear visual feedback for user interactions

## Performance Guidelines
- Minimize JavaScript usage in QML components
- Use C++ models for heavy data processing
- Implement proper caching for visualization data
- Profile rendering performance regularly

## Integration Patterns
- Connect to Rust backend through proper C++ interfaces
- Handle asynchronous data updates gracefully
- Implement error states for connection failures
- Use signals/slots pattern for clean separation
