# Consciousness Modeling Guidelines

## Mathematical Models
- **Dual MÃ¶bius Gaussian**: Core consciousness representation
- **EchoMemoria**: Memory persistence and recall mechanisms
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Time-based consciousness evolution

## Implementation Patterns
- Use Rust for performance-critical consciousness simulation
- Maintain mathematical precision in floating-point operations
- Document all consciousness model parameters and their meanings
- Validate model outputs against expected consciousness behaviors

## Testing Consciousness Models
- Always test mathematical correctness before integration
- Use `./test_dual_mobius_gaussian.sh` for model validation
- Monitor memory usage during consciousness simulation
- Verify real-time performance constraints are met

## Documentation Requirements
- Mathematical formulas should be clearly documented
- Consciousness state transitions need detailed explanations
- Performance benchmarks for each model component
- Integration points between different consciousness modules
