# Niodoo Architecture ↔ finalREADME Alignment

**Problem**: finalREADME describes idealized modular architecture (tcs-core, tcs-tda, etc), but Niodoo codebase is structured differently.

**Solution**: This document maps finalREADME concepts to actual Niodoo locations and identifies integration gaps.

## Key Gaps Analysis

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Blocks Integration)
1. **TQFT Engine Not Implemented**
   - finalREADME: Full implementation of Atiyah-Segal axioms
   - Niodoo: Theoretical structure only
   - Impact: Cannot do higher-order reasoning

2. **Workspace Structure Mismatch**
   - finalREADME: 6 modular crates with clear boundaries
   - Niodoo: Single workspace with 30+ binaries
   - Impact: Module organization unclear

### 🟡 IMPORTANT (Affects Features)
1. **Pipeline Orchestration Incomplete**
   - Missing: Unified orchestrator connecting all stages
   - Scattered: Logic split across multiple binaries

2. **Knot Analysis Pipeline**
   - Missing: Complete projection methods (Isomap, BallMapper, UMAP)
   - Missing: Full Jones polynomial caching strategy

3. **Consensus Module**
   - Mentioned but not fully implemented
   - Needs: Raft integration + vocabulary evolution

4. **Memory Optimization**
   - Missing: CUDA memory pool management
   - Missing: Pinned memory strategies

### 🟢 WORKING (Can Use As-Is)
1. State management (CognitiveState)
2. Event system (CognitiveEventBus)
3. Persistence computation (Ripser engine)
4. Configuration system
5. Docker setup (basic)

---

## Integration Path (Recommended: Option B)

### Phase 1: Clarify Module Responsibilities (1 week)
1. **Document what each src/* module actually does** (vs. what it should do)
2. **Consolidate scattered functionality** into coherent modules
3. **Create clear interfaces** between modules

### Phase 2: Fill Critical Gaps (2-3 weeks)
1. **Implement TQFT Engine**
   - Start with 2D Frobenius algebra (simplest case)
   - Use as foundation for reasoning

2. **Complete Knot Analysis Pipeline**
   - Add missing projection methods
   - Implement proper caching

3. **Unified Orchestrator**
   - Create single entry point (master_consciousness_orchestrator)
   - Pipeline stages properly connected

### Phase 3: Performance & Production (1-2 weeks)
1. **CUDA Memory Optimization**
2. **Comprehensive Benchmarking**
3. **Kubernetes deployment**

### Phase 4: Documentation (ongoing)
1. Update `.kiro/` with actual implementation decisions
2. Create module-level READMEs
3. Document deviations from finalREADME (and why)

## Cargo.toml Alignment

### Current Structure (Niodoo)
```toml
[workspace]
members = ["src"]

[package]
name = "niodoo"
# 30+ binary targets

[features]
# mobius-torus, gaussian-processes, k-twist, parallel, cuda, etc.
```

### finalREADME Suggested Structure
```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "tcs-core",
    "tcs-tda",
    "tcs-knot",
    "tcs-tqft",
    "tcs-ml",
    "tcs-consensus",
]
```

### Recommendation
**Keep current structure** but reorganize `src/` subdirectories to match module intent:
```
src/
├── core/              # Core cognitive state (finalREADME's tcs-core)
├── tda/              # Topology data analysis (finalREADME's tcs-tda)
├── knot/             # Knot theory (finalREADME's tcs-knot)
├── tqft/             # TQFT (finalREADME's tcs-tqft) ← MISSING
├── learning/         # ML/RL (finalREADME's tcs-ml)
├── consensus/        # Consensus mechanisms (finalREADME's tcs-consensus)
└── bin/              # All binaries
```
