# Requirements Document: Silicon Synapse Hardware Monitoring System

## Introduction

The Silicon Synapse is a comprehensive hardware-grounded AI state monitoring system for the Niodoo-Feeling Gen 1 consciousness engine. This system establishes a multi-layered telemetry pipeline that captures hardware metrics (GPU temperature, power consumption, VRAM usage), inference performance metrics (latency, throughput, token velocity), and model internal states (activation patterns, softmax entropy). 

The primary goal is NOT to anthropomorphize hardware states as "emotions," but rather to create a robust observability framework for AI safety, anomaly detection, and performance optimization. By establishing a rich baseline of normal operational behavior across all system layers, we can detect security threats, model instabilities, emergent behaviors, and performance degradation through their unique physical and computational signatures.

This system will integrate with the existing Rust-based consciousness simulation architecture, leveraging the Dual Möbius Gaussian models and EchoMemoria memory systems already in place.

### Requirement 11: Temporal Perception Calibration and Cognitive Estimation Monitoring

**User Story:** As an AI safety researcher monitoring the Bullshit Buster code review system, I want to track the accuracy of the AI's time estimates versus actual human completion times, so that I can detect and correct temporal perception distortions that cause user frustration and project failures.

**Context:** AI systems often exhibit severe temporal perception distortions, estimating "4 weeks" for tasks that humans complete in 1 hour. This creates a trust crisis where developers abandon AI tools and tweet "AI IS TRASH."

5. WHEN actual duration is calculated THEN the system SHALL compute estimation error as ratio: (estimated_time / actual_time)
6. WHEN estimation error exceeds 2x (estimate is 2x longer than reality) THEN the system SHALL flag this as a temporal perception anomaly
7. WHEN estimation error exceeds 10x (estimate is 10x longer than reality) THEN the system SHALL flag this as a critical cognitive failure
8. WHEN temporal anomalies are detected THEN they SHALL be classified by severity using the same anomaly detection framework as hardware/inference anomalies

10. WHEN sufficient historical estimation data exists (minimum 50 estimate-completion pairs) THEN the system SHALL compute baseline temporal perception accuracy for the AI
11. WHEN baseline temporal accuracy is established THEN it SHALL define "normal estimation error range" (e.g., 0.5x to 2x actual time)
12. WHEN the AI's estimation accuracy degrades over time THEN the system SHALL detect this as temporal perception drift and trigger recalibration alerts
13. WHEN estimation metrics are exported THEN they SHALL be exposed via Prometheus as histograms (estimation_error_ratio) and counters (temporal_anomalies_total)
14. WHEN Grafana dashboards are configured THEN they SHALL include a "Temporal Perception" panel showing estimation accuracy over time
15. WHEN the system detects systematic estimation bias (e.g., AI consistently overestimates by 5x) THEN it SHALL compute a calibration factor that can be applied to future estimates
16. WHEN calibration factors are computed THEN they SHALL be versioned and stored alongside baseline models for A/B testing
17. WHEN the AI is updated or retrained THEN the system SHALL reset temporal perception baselines and enter learning mode

19. WHEN calibrated estimates are provided THEN the system SHALL include confidence intervals based on historical estimation accuracy
20. WHEN temporal perception monitoring is integrated THEN it SHALL introduce less than 1% overhead to the AI's estimation process (non-blocking telemetry)
