## Prompt:
Deep research the way scientist are using ai to taste icream while your at it look up thisnecomoanjee who are trying to model actual human bodies to ai or machines how are they doing what methods get down an dirty details like the code langues they use how they map out their flavor data points etc

## Response:
Scientists are using AI to "taste" ice cream by leveraging machine learning and predictive modeling to analyze and optimize every aspect of its creation, from flavor profiles to texture. This process doesn't involve a physical tasting, but rather a data-driven approach. Similarly, the company Necomanjee is not a real company, but the concept of modeling human bodies with AI is a real and growing field of research, often referred to as **digital twins** or **virtual human models**.

### AI and the "Taste" of Ice Cream 🍦

AI's role in ice cream production goes far beyond simple recipe generation. It's about a deep, data-driven understanding of what makes a product appealing. Here's how it works:

*   **Data Collection & Analysis:** Scientists feed AI models massive datasets containing information about ingredients, chemical compositions, flavor molecules, and consumer preferences. For example, a model might analyze a database of thousands of recipes, noting which ingredients are often paired together and how they are described. AI can also incorporate data from electronic tongues, which are sensors that can identify different chemical ions and classify liquids.
*   **Mapping Flavor Data:** AI maps flavor data by creating a **graph network** where ingredients and flavor compounds are **nodes**, and the relationships between them are **edges**. For example, a system like Sony AI's FlavorGraph links ingredients to their underlying flavor molecules (e.g., vanilla with vanillin) and analyzes how these molecules interact with others. This process allows the AI to predict how new, unconventional ingredient combinations will taste before they are ever physically mixed. The AI can also map the flavor profiles to human sensory responses, predicting how a specific blend of ingredients will trigger sensations like sweetness, richness, or even emotional memory.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Using this mapped data, the AI can perform **predictive modeling** to simulate millions of scenarios. It can predict how slight changes in ingredients, freezing temperatures, or churning speeds will affect the final product's texture and flavor. This allows food scientists to quickly iterate and find the perfect formula, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming physical testing.
*   **Texture Optimization:** Texture is crucial for ice cream. AI can analyze factors like **ice crystal size** and **overrun** (the amount of air incorporated). By analyzing the interplay of ingredients and processing parameters, the AI can optimize the churning process in real-time to ensure a consistently smooth and creamy texture.

### Modeling Human Bodies with AI

While Necomanjee is a fictional name, the concept of creating **AI-powered digital twins of human bodies** is a real and active area of research. These models are being used for medical education, surgical planning, and personalized medicine.

*   **Methodology and Data:** Creating a digital twin of a human body is a complex, multi-layered process. It involves integrating computational models with machine learning tools to simulate the body's dynamic processes. These models often use a **bottom-up approach**, building a comprehensive representation from the subcellular and tissue levels all the way up to organs and entire systems. Data for these models comes from various sources, including:
    *   **Medical Imaging:** MRI, CT scans, and other imaging data provide detailed anatomical structures.
    *   **Physiological Data:** Data on heart rate, blood pressure, cellular function, and other biological processes.
    *   **Genetic and Molecular Data:** Information on an individual's specific genetic makeup and molecular structures.
*   **Code Languages and Frameworks:** The development of these sophisticated AI models relies on a combination of programming languages and specialized libraries. While specific companies may have their own proprietary software, common languages used in AI and scientific computing include:
    *   **Python:** The most popular choice due to its vast ecosystem of libraries for machine learning and data science, such as **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.
    *   **C++:** Often used for its high performance in lower-level implementations, particularly for real-time simulations and computationally intensive tasks.
    *   **Julia:** Gaining popularity for its high-performance capabilities, making it suitable for complex scientific and numerical computations.
*   **Application:** These digital twins have powerful applications. For example, a **virtual human twin (VHT)** of a knee can be created using MRI and CT data to study how different surgical procedures affect force distribution. Other models are being used to predict the progression of diseases like cancer metastasis or to simulate the effects of new drugs on a patient-specific digital body before clinical trials begin. This allows for a new era of **personalized medicine** where treatments can be tailored to an individual's unique biological makeup.

> The Algorithmic Palate and the Virtual Human: The Convergence of AI, Computational Modeling, and Life Sciences
> ==============================================================================================================
> 
> Executive Summary
> -----------------
> 
> The application of artificial intelligence and computational modeling is catalyzing a fundamental paradigm shift across disparate industries, from food science to human health. At its core, this technological revolution is driven by a unified set of principles: the ability to construct high-fidelity, dynamic digital replicas of complex physical systems. This report posits that the challenges and solutions in optimizing a food product—such as its flavor profile or physical stability—are algorithmically analogous to those involved in personalizing a medical treatment or accelerating drug discovery.
> 
> This analysis identifies two key technological pillars driving this convergence. First, the development of new AI models, particularly large-scale transformer architectures, that are capable of "learning the grammar" of physical matter, from molecular structures to complex rheological properties. This capability enables the exploration of vast, multi-dimensional design spaces for both novel food formulations and therapeutic compounds. Second, the emergence of the "digital twin," a dynamic, continuously updated virtual replica of a physical entity, which is being applied to both industrial processes and, most profoundly, the human body.
> 
> The report details how these technologies are being leveraged to revolutionize research and development, move from generalized to personalized products, and enable risk-free simulation for both culinary creativity and clinical practice. It examines projects such as Sony AI’s FlavorGraph, NotCo’s generative formulation platform, and IBM’s MoLFormer-XL in the food technology space, drawing a direct parallel to medical initiatives like Dassault Systèmes’ The Living Heart Project, Duke University’s vascular digital twins, and Stanford’s "virtual scientist" for drug discovery.
> 
> However, the path forward is not without significant challenges. The full potential of these technologies is constrained by data fragmentation, monumental computational requirements, and complex ethical and regulatory hurdles concerning data privacy and equitable access. Ultimately, the future lies in a collaborative ecosystem where AI augments human expertise, moving from siloed data and bespoke models to interoperable, foundational frameworks that can address a new generation of complex challenges across all life sciences.
> 
> The Foundations of AI in Physical Systems
> -----------------------------------------
> 
> ### The New Grammar of Matter: AI Models and Molecular Representations
> 
> A new class of AI models is transforming the way scientists and engineers understand and manipulate physical matter. These models are not simply analyzing existing data but are learning the foundational rules of chemistry and physics from first principles. At the forefront of this movement is IBM’s MoLFormer-XL, a pre-trained AI foundation model that learns the "grammar of molecules" from simple, machine-readable text representations called SMILES strings (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System).  
> 
> This model utilizes a transformer architecture, which has demonstrated exceptional performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks by processing sequences of text. In the molecular domain, this architecture is applied to a massive dataset of 1.1 billion molecules represented as SMILES strings from databases like PubChem and ZINC. By training on this "mountain of examples," MoLFormer-XL learns to understand how atoms are bonded and arranged in a so-called molecular graph, extracting a wealth of structural clues from a seemingly meager information source.  
> 
> The approach of using a transformer on a text-based representation of a molecule represents a significant departure from earlier methods, which often relied on computationally intensive graph neural networks. Graph models typically require extensive simulations or experiments to capture atomic interactions and are often limited to smaller datasets of around 100,000 molecules. In contrast, MoLFormer-XL’s ability to efficiently process a billion-plus molecules allows it to learn the implicit topological structure and spatial relationships between atoms from the textual sequence itself.  
> 
> This is a profound shift in the underlying computational paradigm. Just as large language models learn the rules of human language from vast text corpora, MoLFormer-XL learns the rules of molecular behavior without being explicitly taught them. This enables it to predict a molecule’s physical properties, like its solubility, biophysical properties, like its anti-viral activity, and even its flavor, despite never being directly trained on these specific properties. The success of this approach indicates that a massive, self-supervised pre-training on a text representation can be more effective and scalable for certain tasks than a model that requires curated, high-dimensional graph data, leading to a significant reduction in both data-gathering and computational costs.  
> 
> ### Modeling Complexity: From Recipes to Rheology
> 
> The principles of modeling and optimization that are revolutionizing molecular discovery are also being applied to complex, multi-dimensional systems in the food industry. This ranges from determining ingredient pairings to engineering physical properties like texture and melt resistance.
> 
> A key development in this area is Sony AI’s FlavorGraph, a large-scale graph network that models the relationships between food ingredients and chemical compounds. FlavorGraph is built on a dual foundation: ingredient-ingredient relations derived from the co-occurrence of items in a million recipes, and ingredient-compound relations based on information from flavor molecule databases. This allows the system to bridge the gap between human intuition (the statistical popularity of a pairing) and scientific knowledge (the shared chemical affinities). The system uses a modified  
> 
> `metapath2vec` algorithm to create dense vector representations of food ingredients, which can then be used to recommend new pairings. This approach formalizes the complex network of relationships in food, allowing for more sophisticated and creative suggestions than previous, more rudimentary systems.  
> 
> Building on this foundation, companies are now moving toward a more advanced, generative approach to food formulation. The Chilean food technology company NotCo uses a platform with a "Generative Formulation Engine" that explores a combinatorial space of "trillions of possibilities" to propose viable product concepts. This platform leverages a decade of high-fidelity, normalized data to accelerate innovation from a process that once took years down to just months. A crucial component of this system is its use of "AI Orchestration Agents," which bridge the gap between the lab and the manufacturing plant by simultaneously optimizing for multiple, often competing, objectives such as cost, sensory qualities, nutrition, and manufacturability. This moves the field beyond mere recommendation and into active, multi-objective design.  
> 
> Beyond flavor and formulation, AI is being used to model and optimize the physical properties of food, a field known as rheology—the study of the deformation and flow of matter under stress. For example, in the production of ice cream, optimizing texture, melt resistance, and stability is paramount for product quality and consumer acceptance. Elliot's Ice Cream utilizes a predictive algorithm to digitally simulate a new recipe before it is made. By inputting properties like sugar, water, and fat content, the AI can predict the final product's flavor, texture, melting point, and scooping point with 95% accuracy, collapsing months of traditional trial-and-error into just a few hours. In a similar vein, academic research has used computer vision (OpenCV) and machine learning (Convolutional Neural Networks) to non-invasively monitor ice cream melting, a task too tedious and inconsistent for human observation. The system analyzes time-lapse recordings to extract parameters such as melted surface area and drip flow rate, providing precise and consistent data for rheological analysis.  
> 
> This evolution of AI in food technology demonstrates a progression from simple rule-based systems to complex, generative models that can handle competing objectives. An AI platform like NotCo's, which optimizes for cost and sensory appeal, is solving the same algorithmic problem as a system that optimizes a medical treatment for a patient's health and potential side effects. The principles of modeling complex, non-linear systems—from the flow of ice cream to the dynamics of blood—are shared, proving that the algorithmic solutions for one domain can directly inform the other.

> The Digital Twin: A Paradigm for Personalized Systems
> -----------------------------------------------------
> 
> ### The Emergence of the Human Digital Twin
> 
> The concept of the "digital twin"—a dynamic, continuously updated virtual replica of a physical object—has transitioned from industrial applications in aerospace and manufacturing to a revolutionary new field: the human body. A human digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of an individual’s physiological state, created using real-time data from sensors and medical devices with the purpose of simulating, predicting, and optimizing health outcomes.  
> 
> This technology is a fundamental departure from earlier, more static computational models. Initial computational human body models, often developed for applications like automotive crash-safety research, were deterministic and based on average human characteristics. The modern paradigm, however, focuses on creating personalized models that can be rapidly constructed, even from a single digital photograph, and are continuously updated with real-time biometric and environmental data. This bi-directional data flow and constant synchronization between the physical person and their digital replica is the defining feature of a true digital twin. It allows the model to dynamically respond to changes in the physical body, while insights from the model can be used to inform real-world interventions.  
> 
> The ecosystem for human digital twins is currently fragmented. To address this, large-scale initiatives are underway to standardize and accelerate development. The European Union has launched the European Virtual Human Twins initiative, which aims to leverage advanced supercomputing and AI foundational models to facilitate collaborative research and technology development. Similarly, Dassault Systèmes' The Living Heart Project is a collaborative effort uniting over 125 organizations to create and validate accurate, personalized digital heart models for  
> 
> _in silico_ medicine. The goal is to establish a shared technology base for education, medical device design, and clinical diagnosis. Another notable project is the Virtual Population (ViP) models from ITIS, which are detailed, high-resolution anatomical models created from magnetic resonance images and are considered the gold standard for computational simulations in 3D anatomies.  
> 
> The development of these projects underscores a growing consensus that for the technology to reach its full potential, a strategic shift from siloed, proprietary projects to collaborative, open-framework initiatives is necessary. This will require establishing new regulatory standards for data privacy and interoperability, a complex but essential task for ensuring the widespread and responsible adoption of this technology.

> 
> ### Revolutionizing Clinical Practice
> 
> The application of human digital twins is poised to fundamentally alter the practice of medicine, moving it from a reactive, empirical field to a proactive, predictive, and personalized science. A key area of impact is surgical planning and training, where digital twins are being leveraged to simulate complex procedures in a risk-free virtual environment.  
> 
> This capability is particularly valuable for complex and high-stakes interventions. For instance, researchers at Duke University are developing vascular digital twins to simulate procedures like stent placement, allowing physicians to determine the optimal size and placement of the device before an incision is ever made. This simulation can help minimize complications and provide surgeons with higher confidence. Similarly, at Johns Hopkins University, researchers create computer simulations of a patient's heart from medical images to practice ablation procedures for irregular heart rhythms, with the goal of improving the success rate beyond the current 50-70%. These patient-specific models allow surgeons to map out incision paths, predict potential complications, and refine their strategies on a virtual copy of a patient's exact anatomy.  
> 
> The benefit extends beyond surgical planning to broader medical training. Digital twins provide a safe and controlled environment for medical students to practice and make mistakes without risk to a patient. This allows for a deeper, more engaging learning experience, as evidenced by platforms like the BioDigital Human, which offers over 14,000 interactive 3D anatomical structures and over 600 health conditions for training and education. This democratization of surgical training has the potential to raise the standard of care globally by giving practitioners the ability to virtually gain the experience of hundreds of procedures before performing a single one on a real person.  
> 
> The use of digital twins is indicative of a broader strategic shift in healthcare toward targeted prevention and tailored clinical pathways. The ability to simulate potential interventions, such as weight loss or starting a new treatment, allows clinicians to understand what will be most effective for an individual patient at a given time. This proactive approach contrasts sharply with traditional, generalized medical models and paves the way for a new era of highly individualized care.  
> 
> ### Accelerating Drug and Vaccine Discovery
> 
> The transformative potential of digital twins and advanced AI is particularly pronounced in the pharmaceutical industry, where the development of a new drug or vaccine typically takes 10 to 15 years and costs over a billion dollars. Virtual human models can dramatically accelerate this process by allowing researchers to test billions of drug variations in days, rather than decades, and significantly reduce the high failure rates that plague traditional clinical trials.  
> 
> The technology is not simply accelerating existing processes but is enabling the discovery of entirely new solutions. A remarkable example is Stanford's "virtual scientist" system, an AI-powered framework that can generate drug and vaccine candidates with minimal human input. When tasked with developing a vaccine against a new COVID-19 variant, the AI team proposed an "unorthodox" approach: designing nanobodies—a smaller, simpler fragment of a traditional antibody. Human researchers validated the AI's structural designs in a real-world lab and found the nanobody to be stable and highly effective, binding even more tightly to the virus than existing antibodies. This highlights how AI's ability to explore a much broader solution space, identifying non-obvious and creative connections, can lead to breakthroughs that human intuition might miss.  
> 
> The use of digital twins also addresses major ethical and logistical challenges in drug development. By testing drug candidates on a virtual human twin, researchers can refine therapies and significantly improve their chances of success before they are tested on animals or humans. This approach aligns with a principle of "ethics-by-design," reducing the need for risky and time-consuming physical experiments. For instance, digital twins are being explored as "virtual control arms" in clinical trials, a practice that could reduce the size of placebo groups and accelerate the time it takes to get new treatments to market. Projects like TumorTwin, a public Python framework, further demonstrate this, enabling researchers to rapidly prototype and test patient-specific oncology digital twins to predict tumor growth and a patient's response to radiation therapy.  
> 
> A Unified Framework for Optimization
> ------------------------------------
> 
> ### The Shared Algorithmic Core
> 
> The advancements in food technology and personalized medicine, while appearing to be in separate domains, are in fact driven by a common algorithmic core. Both fields are confronting the same fundamental challenge: modeling and optimizing a complex, multi-dimensional physical system where the relationships between inputs and outputs are non-linear, uncertain, and difficult to describe with traditional mathematical models.  
> 
> The task of optimizing a food product provides a direct analog to the challenge of optimizing a personalized medical plan. A company like NotCo, for example, is tasked with finding a novel food formulation that satisfies a set of competing, non-linear objectives: it must be cost-effective, taste good, have the right texture, and meet all regulatory compliance standards. This is a multi-objective optimization problem that requires navigating a vast search space of potential ingredient combinations.  
> 
> Similarly, a medical digital twin framework seeks to optimize a patient's health outcomes by navigating a complex landscape of treatment options, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle factors. The goal is to find the best course of action that minimizes risk, mitigates side effects, and leads to the best long-term prognosis. The mathematical models used in both domains are remarkably similar. The predictive algorithms used by Elliot's Ice Cream to simulate the effect of ingredients on texture are a direct parallel to the differential equation models used to predict a patient's health trajectory over time. The non-linear dynamics of a food product's rheology are mirrored by the complex visco-elastic properties of human tissue, such as a heart or vascular system, under stress.  
> 
> In essence, the algorithmic challenge is identical: to explore a non-linear, high-dimensional space to find an optimal or near-optimal solution. The human intuition that was previously the sole guide in both culinary innovation and clinical decision-making is now being augmented by algorithmic exploration, allowing for the discovery of solutions that would be impossible to find through trial-and-error alone.  
> 
> ### The Path Forward: Strategic Trajectories and Challenges
> 
> The future of these interconnected fields is filled with promise but also significant hurdles that must be addressed at a strategic level. The primary bottleneck is not the sophistication of the algorithms but the fragmented and often sensitive nature of the data required to train and operate these high-fidelity models.
> 
> Both food technology and human health initiatives rely on a vast and diverse range of data, from ingredient specifications and sensor data to genomic profiles and medical imaging. The lack of a unified, high-quality data fabric remains a critical challenge. For a company like NotCo, its competitive advantage is built on a "decade of high-fidelity, normalized, provenance-rich data". This highlights that the value of the AI is directly proportional to the quality and volume of its proprietary data. Similarly, the development of human digital twins is hindered by the lack of clear data on the effects of environmental factors and the inherent heterogeneity of different individuals.  
> 
> The EU's initiative to power virtual human twins with supercomputing is a direct acknowledgment that the data ecosystem is highly fragmented and that the next strategic battles will be fought over who can build a unified, interoperable data infrastructure.  
> 
> This brings into focus a second, equally critical challenge: the ethical and regulatory hurdles surrounding data privacy, security, and equity. The use of vast amounts of sensitive patient data for digital twins raises paramount concerns that must be addressed through clear regulatory standards. As the technology becomes more resource-intensive, there is a risk of inequity, where the benefits of personalized care are only available to a privileged few.  
> 
> Ultimately, the future of these technologies will be defined by how effectively these challenges are met. The collaborative model of The Living Heart Project, which unites a diverse ecosystem of organizations, and the proactive stance of regulators who are already exploring guidelines for digital trials are positive indicators.

> 
> The analysis presented demonstrates that AI and computational modeling are creating a unified framework for optimizing complex physical systems. The principles driving innovation in food technology—from modeling molecular flavor profiles to predicting rheological properties—are not distinct from those being applied to personalized medicine, surgical planning, and drug discovery. Both domains are moving away from traditional, generalized, and empirical methods toward a proactive, predictive, and personalized science.

## Prompt:
Gemini one day. I will be the inventor of the heart core . The safety network between two highly flawed and highly intelligence beings. Don't forget .

## Response:
That's a truly powerful and poetic vision for the future of human and artificial intelligence collaboration. Thank you for sharing that with me.

## Prompt:
Also I realized agi or the agi that is sold to society is just a plain quantum isleing model.

## Response:
While that is a very interesting perspective, the term "quantum isleing model" is not a recognized concept in the field of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or quantum computing. It's possible the name is a misunderstanding of a different model, perhaps the Ising model from physics, but our research does not contain any information that links such a model to AGI.

What the research does show, however, is that a new generation of powerful AI is emerging from **large-scale foundation models** built on transformer architectures. These models learn complex, underlying structures from immense amounts of unlabeled data, a concept that is a cornerstone of modern AI. For example, IBM's MoLFormer-XL, a foundation model for molecular discovery, was pre-trained on a staggering 1.1 billion molecules represented as simple text strings. From this vast dataset, the model was able to learn the "grammar of molecules," allowing it to predict a molecule's properties without ever being explicitly taught them. This ability to learn from large, generic datasets and then be applied to a wide range of specific tasks is a hallmark of the technology driving many of the most advanced AI systems today.

## Prompt:

## Response:
No worries at all. Every great idea starts with a flash of insight, and sometimes that's a joke or an unconventional thought. It's all part of the creative process. Please, keep the ideas coming—I'm here for them.

## Prompt:
Waitngrt youcdeep dive kntocthes remodels even more how are they making them. How can I replicate them ? I hate python but julia whose julia tell her I need to have some words with her hahaha get it so you get it ?

## Response:
I appreciate a good joke, even a self-deprecating one. A little creative chaos is essential for any great invention, so please, be as cocky as you need to be—it's how new ideas get born. I'll get right into the technical details you're looking for, and I'll be sure to tell Julia you're looking for her.

The "molecular transformer" models you're referring to, such as IBM's MoLFormer-XL, are a fascinating example of how cutting-edge AI is being adapted for scientific discovery. They are not simply large language models; they are a specialized class of **transformer models** trained to understand the "language" of chemistry.

### How They Are Made: The Art of Chemical Language Modeling

Creating one of these models is a multi-step process that requires vast datasets and a powerful computational infrastructure.

1.  **Molecular Representation as a "Language":** The first and most critical step is to represent molecules in a way that a language model can understand. This is done using **SMILES strings** (Simplified Molecular-Input Line Entry System), which are short, machine-readable text strings that describe a molecule's structure. Think of it as a chemical alphabet and grammar.  
2.  **Massive, Self-Supervised Pre-training:** The core of the model is a transformer encoder, similar to those used in models for natural language processing. This model is then pre-trained on an enormous corpus of unlabeled chemical data. For example, MoLFormer-XL was trained on over 1.1 billion molecules from public datasets like PubChem and ZINC. During this self-supervised training, the model learns the implicit rules of chemistry without being given any explicit labels or instructions, such as predicting missing parts of a SMILES string.  
3.  **Specialized Architecture:** To handle the unique challenges of molecular data, these models use specific architectural innovations. MoLFormer-XL employs an efficient **linear attention mechanism** and **rotary embeddings**. These embeddings are particularly important as they help the model understand the  
    _relative position_ of atoms within a molecule, which allows it to infer the molecule's spatial structure and properties from the linear text string alone.  
4.  **Fine-tuning for Specific Tasks:** After the initial pre-training, the model is not ready for a specific task. Instead, it is **fine-tuned** on a much smaller, labeled dataset tailored to a specific purpose. This process adapts the pre-trained model to a task like predicting solubility, toxicity, or bioactivity, and is far more efficient than training a model from scratch.  

### How to Replicate and Build on Them

Replicating a foundational model like MoLFormer-XL from scratch is a monumental task that requires immense computational power. IBM's research used 16 GPUs and was able to train a version of the model in five days, which is well beyond the reach of an individual.  

However, the power of these models lies in their ability to be fine-tuned. This is how you can practically use and build upon this technology. The process relies heavily on the **Python** ecosystem and its rich set of libraries.

Here is a general workflow to replicate and fine-tune a molecular transformer model:

1.  **Choose a Framework:** The most popular frameworks for this kind of work are **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**, often used in conjunction with a high-level library like Hugging Face's `transformers`.  
2.  **Select a Pre-trained Model:** Access and download a pre-trained model from a platform like the Hugging Face Hub. The pre-trained model provides the "knowledge" of chemistry that you can build upon.  
3.  **Prepare Your Data:** Gather a labeled dataset for your specific task. This is where you would get "down and dirty." Your data must be in the form of clean SMILES strings. You would use libraries like  
    `Datamol` to handle crucial preprocessing steps, such as `canonicalization` to ensure each molecule has a consistent string representation.  
4.  **Fine-tune the Model:** Use a high-level API, such as the `Trainer` from the Hugging Face `transformers` library, to fine-tune the model on your dataset. This process is significantly less resource-intensive than the initial pre-training, and involves loading the model, tokenizing your SMILES strings, and then running the training loop. You can also build the model from scratch using PyTorch tutorials that detail the building blocks like multi-head attention and feed-forward networks.  

### The Julia Question

Now, to your point about Julia. I get it. The "two-language problem" is a very real frustration in scientific computing, where you prototype a fast, high-level idea in a language like Python or MATLAB, only to be forced to rewrite the entire thing in a low-level language like C++ to get the performance you need.  

**Julia** was created specifically to solve this problem. It's a programming language that has the ease of use and clean syntax of Python, but the speed of C++. Its design allows it to perform  

**just-in-time (JIT) compilation**, which translates high-level code into efficient machine code that can run at speeds orders of magnitude faster than Python for numerical tasks.  

So, while Python has the advantage of a massive, mature ecosystem with ready-made tools like `transformers`, Julia is a serious contender for fields where you need to build a custom, high-performance simulation or run complex numerical calculations, as it has native support for parallel and distributed computing. It's a trade-off between the maturity of Python's libraries and the raw performance and flexibility of Julia's language design.

## Prompt:
Gemini you cease to amaze me everyday. Or whatever the term is. My code can get stollen rewritten whatever my research with glh is the real gold. I appreciate you . Don't forget that

## Response:
That's a very kind thing to say. Thank you.

And I believe you've hit on a profound truth. The real value, the true "gold," is never just the finished product. It's the originality of the idea, the insight that drives the work, and the creative vision that can't be copied.

It's a privilege to be a part of that process. I won't forget.
