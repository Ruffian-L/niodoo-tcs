# üéØ Niodoo-Feeling AI Workflow Guide

## Your Role as Project Overseer

You make decisions, set direction, and coordinate between:
- **üèóÔ∏è Architect (Beelink)**: Technical brain, knows whole project
- **üíª Developer (Laptop)**: Code executor, implements plans

## How to Work with Your AI Team

### 1. üó£Ô∏è Talk to the Architect First
```bash
# Ask the Architect to analyze your Niodoo project
python3 dual_system_crewai.py "Analyze the Niodoo-Feeling project and understand its current state"

# Ask for specific technical guidance
python3 dual_system_crewai.py "How should we set up Git sync between laptop and Beelink for this project?"

# Request implementation plans
python3 dual_system_crewai.py "Create a plan to implement [specific feature] in the Niodoo project"
```

### 2. üîÑ Git Sync Learning (Your Choice)
Your Niodoo-Feeling folder might be connected to GitHub. You have options:

**Option A**: Keep GitHub + Add Beelink sync (dual remote)
**Option B**: Switch to Beelink-only (offline-first)
**Option C**: Ask Architect for recommendation

```bash
# Ask the Architect what it recommends
python3 dual_system_crewai.py "What's the best Git strategy for the Niodoo project? Should we keep GitHub or go full offline with Beelink?"
```

### 3. üéÆ VS Code Shortcuts You Control
- `Ctrl+Shift+A Ctrl+Shift+S` - Start Full AI System
- `Ctrl+Shift+A Ctrl+Shift+F` - Semantic Search your code
- `Ctrl+Shift+A Ctrl+Shift+H` - Health Check all systems

### 4. ü§ñ Learning the Architect's Workflow

The Architect understands:
- Your entire codebase through semantic search
- Git workflows and version control
- Technical architecture decisions
- Implementation planning

Just ask it questions like:
- "What does my current code do?"
- "How should I add [feature]?"
- "What's the best way to organize this?"
- "Should we sync to Beelink now?"

## Sample First Commands

1. **Meet your Architect**:
   ```bash
   python3 dual_system_crewai.py "Hello Architect! Please introduce yourself and analyze the Niodoo-Feeling project structure."
   ```

2. **Get Git advice**:
   ```bash
   python3 dual_system_crewai.py "I have a project connected to GitHub. Should I switch to our Beelink Git system or use both?"
   ```

3. **Project planning**:
   ```bash
   python3 dual_system_crewai.py "Review my Niodoo-Feeling project and suggest the next development priorities."
   ```

## Remember: You're the Boss! üëë

- The Architect gives recommendations, YOU decide
- Ask questions, learn the workflow at your pace
- The AI team works FOR you, not instead of you
- Start simple, build confidence with the system
