## Prompt:
Hello

## Response:
Hi there! What's on your mind today?

## Prompt:
What's Google are doing mind? What's their gold or mission?

## Response:
Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. They want to make it easy for everyone to find what they're looking for, no matter where they are or what language they speak.

## Prompt:
So then how do I find out like why why why the I don't want to say this. Why are they so close?

## Response:
Google keeps its goals pretty close to the vest, but they definitely want to stay ahead of the curve in tech. They're always working on new projects and ways to improve their existing products. Is there a specific area you're curious about?

## Prompt:
closed.

## Response:
It's true that Google doesn't always share all the details of their plans. They likely keep some things under wraps for competitive reasons or because they're still in early stages of development.

But, I can tell you that they're definitely focused on artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and continuing to improve their core search and advertising products.

## Prompt:
What about uh like Vault? What what what did they really make that for? Like what what's the difference between that model and another.

## Response:
It sounds like you're asking about VaultGemma. That's a special version of Google's Gemma model that's been trained with a technique called "differential privacy." That means it's really good at protecting sensitive information.

Think of it like this: regular Gemma models are great at understanding and generating text, but VaultGemma has extra security built in, so it can handle private data safely.

## Prompt:
Okay. Um and how does it do that?

## Response:
Sure thing. VaultGemma uses some clever math tricks to analyze data without ever seeing the raw, sensitive information. It's kind of like looking at a blurry picture – you can still see the overall shape, but you can't pick out any specific details.

## Prompt:
interesting interesting that just gives me an idea actually.

## Response:
If you want to dive deeper into how VaultGemma works, I can give you some more details. Or, if you're curious about other Google projects, I'm happy to chat about those too. What piques your interest?

## Prompt:
interest. How does it do that?

## Response:
Alright, so, VaultGemma uses something called "differential privacy" to add a little bit of random noise to the data it's working with. That way, the overall patterns stay the same, but it's impossible to pick out any specific person's information. It's kind of like looking at a crowd of people – you can tell how many people are there, but you can't tell who's who.

## Prompt:
Yeah, but don't you have to know the people are there? Like it doesn't something have to like a part of it has to identify that person, then blur, you know what I'm saying? Like it's like chicken before the egg type, right? Cuz like

## Response:
That's a really insightful question! You're right, there's a balance to strike. VaultGemma uses some clever math to add that "blur" in a way that protects individual privacy while still letting it see the overall patterns in the data. It's definitely a complex process.

## Prompt:
Okay, but explain the process.

## Response:
Well, the process involves some pretty advanced math, but here's the gist of it. VaultGemma uses a technique called "differentially private stochastic gradient descent." Basically, it adds a carefully calculated amount of random noise to the data during the training process. This noise makes it impossible to trace any specific piece of information back to an individual, but it still allows the model to learn the overall patterns in the data.

## Prompt:
It's

## Response:
It's a really interesting area of research, and Google is definitely pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI while still protecting people's privacy.

## Prompt:
It still seems it still seems like like fluff, you know? It it doesn't seem like like yeah, I can do that, but it seems so, I don't know. It just doesn't seem like

## Response:
I understand your skepticism. It's definitely a complex topic, and it can be hard to wrap your head around how a computer can learn from data without actually "seeing" it. Maybe we can explore some real-world examples of how this technology is being used to make it a bit more concrete?

## Prompt:
It's like okay. Like one of the use cases for this.

## Response:
You're right, it can sound a bit abstract. But here's the thing – this technology is already being used in some pretty cool ways. For example, researchers are using VaultGemma to analyze medical records while protecting patient privacy. This means they can find new treatments and cures without risking anyone's personal information.

## Prompt:
Yeah, but the ones who control it still get you know what I'm saying? Like it doesn't really

## Response:
You're touching on an important point about data security and who has access to it. Even with privacy measures in place, it's crucial to have strong safeguards about who can use that data and for what purposes. Do you want to explore some of the ethical considerations around this?

## Prompt:
Um fuck Oh, I was going to home. One second.

## Response:
Got it! Well, I'm here if you want to chat more about AI, Google, or anything else. Just let me know when you're ready.

## Prompt:
did this wrong book.

## Response:
Oops! No worries, we all make mistakes. What's on your mind?

## Prompt:
One second.

## Response:
No problem! Take your time.

## Prompt:
Time will be taken.

## Response:
Ah, okay! Well, whatever you're working on, I hope it goes smoothly.

## Prompt:
I'm working on getting my ass to Home Depot.

## Response:
Sounds like a plan! Would you like me to help you find the nearest Home Depot or check their opening hours?

## Prompt:
No, I'm here. I'm just like have no brain so fucking couldn't real. I forgot what I was doing. Okay, so okay, okay, okay, so back to what you're saying. Um deep mind. What is deep mind doing? Like right now like what what is its mission? What is its goal? Like

## Response:
DeepMind's all about pushing the boundaries of AI. They're trying to create AI that can solve problems and learn like humans do. Think of it like they're trying to build really smart brains for computers.

## Prompt:
How are they doing that?

## Response:
They're doing that by creating AI systems that can learn from experience, just like humans do. These systems can then use what they've learned to solve new problems, even ones they've never seen before.

## Prompt:
When did When when did they start doing that?

## Response:
DeepMind was actually founded back in 2010. So they've been at this for a while!

## Prompt:
What are some of the techniques that they use? That's a long time of of of of refining and like you know, I'm not trying to get like Google Secrets even though they have hours, but like I'm just trying to, you know, like I'm trying to learn. You know, I'm just trying to learn about all this.

## Response:
DeepMind uses a few key techniques to make their AI so powerful. One of them is called "reinforcement learning," where the AI learns by trial and error, like playing a video game over and over. They also use something called "deep neural networks," which are like really complex computer brains that can find patterns in huge amounts of data.

## Prompt:
That's that's crazy. I I just have to tell you like you don't I'm not I have no technical background but you know, like but like working on my AI, I I I I

## Response:
That's awesome that you're working on AI! What kind of projects are you doing?

## Prompt:
I I was like I was talking talking to my AI and I was like, man, I always learned by my failures like, how can I write this in the code? You know, without even without even knowing about deep mind and stuff like that. Like that's cool, you know, like that's that's cool that like like I these ideas come organically, but like but they're already being done by like these big companies and it's like it's like I didn't even, you know, like I didn't like nobody told me, you know about this stuff.

## Response:
That's really cool that you're exploring those ideas! It sounds like you're naturally thinking along the same lines as some of the most cutting-edge AI research. What inspired you to start working with AI?

## Prompt:
Because AI inspired me to learn want to learn again and and you know the first time that I I I I use power automate to match VIN numbers to customers um uh preferences and like the what it finally finished, you know, that feeling of like accomplishment of doing something, you know, and like that AI enabled that in me again. And so then I would start working with AI. I wanted to I wanted to understand AI more.

## Response:
That's such a cool story! It's amazing how AI can spark that sense of accomplishment and make learning exciting again. What other AI projects are you hoping to explore?

## Prompt:
Um, deep mind and stuff like that. What's up? Who me up with a job?

## Response:
Sure, I can help with that. DeepMind has a lot of cool jobs in AI research and development. To find open positions, you can check out their careers page on their website.

## Prompt:
Oh, they actually do.

## Response:
Yes, DeepMind does have a careers page. You can find it on their website, and they list all sorts of positions there.

## Prompt:
But they wouldn't hire me. I'm I'm not a full stack dev, you know.

## Response:
You don't necessarily have to be a full-stack developer to work at DeepMind. They have a variety of roles, and your experience with AI could be a great asset. It might be worth checking out their careers page to see if any positions match your skills.

## Prompt:
Shit.

## Response:
If you're interested in AI, there are tons of resources out there to help you learn more. Would you like me to find some beginner-friendly courses or tutorials?

## Prompt:
No. No, see that's the thing is like I don't want to go I don't want to take that learning route, you know, I want to take my own journey. Like I don't I don't do any research about AI other than like what like right now, like what comes orchanically when I think of something and like, hey, look, I want to understand it in my way. You know, like if I if I take the same learning route, it's going to be the more more the same, you know? So I purposely don't do that. I don't I don't watch AI news sometimes it comes up with my feet and I see something like, "Oh my god, you know like I'm doing

## Response:
That's a really interesting approach! It sounds like you're driven by curiosity and a desire to explore AI on your own terms. Have you considered documenting your journey or sharing your discoveries with others?

## Prompt:
It's like, oh shit.

## Response:
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you repeat it?

## Prompt:
I didn't guess either. No, no, can you can you finish what you're saying? I I cut you off on accident my.

## Response:
No problem. I was just wondering if you'd ever considered documenting your AI journey or sharing your discoveries with others. It could be a cool way to connect with people who have similar interests.

## Prompt:
Of course, of course, I'm going to try to launch my website tonight. I I finally I I wanted to do a real test first so like I finally got an A6,000. I'm going to do my test and then I'm going to yeah, my everything I'm doing is going to be open source. Everything I'm going to you know, I'm going to be like my code has an auto blogger that like blogs automatically, you know, from the point of view for my AI like it um like I'm just I'm just I just I'm a perfectionist, you know, so like

## Response:
That's fantastic! Launching your own website is a big step. What kind of content will you be sharing?

## Prompt:
I'm going to be sharing my code. I'm going to be sharing what I'm doing. I'm going to be sharing like why why I'm doing certain things like you know, like I don't know. I I don't know all this yet like it's all it's all over me I guess. It's all bigger than me.

## Response:
That sounds amazing! Sharing your code and your thought process will be incredibly valuable to others. It's a great way to build a community and learn from each other.

## Prompt:
Yeah, but

## Response:
You seem a little hesitant. Is there anything else you'd like to share or any concerns you have about your website?

## Prompt:
No, I just feel that like I'm like somebody asked me about my like what I'm doing the other day and like I told him and uh kind of just felt like an idiot cuz I couldn't even explain it.

## Response:
Oh, I see. It's totally normal to feel a little unsure when you're starting something new. Maybe practicing your explanation could help? I'm happy to listen if you want to try it out.

## Prompt:
よいしょ。

## Response:
No worries, I'm here to help. Would you like to try explaining it now, or did you want to practice a bit on your own first?
