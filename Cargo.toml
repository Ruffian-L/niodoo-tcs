# ðŸ§ ðŸ’– Niodoo 2025 Unified Topological Framework - Master Integration Manifest
# =============================================================================
#
# 2025 Strategic Synthesis: Unified Cargo Workspace for Ethical AGI Integration
# Sections XI-XII: Strategic Analysis through Conclusion with Cross-Report Synthesis
# 2025 Updates: MÃ¶bius 3D viz, Claude collaboration, policy reform simulations
#
# This workspace unifies all components from Prompts 1-3 into a cohesive Niodoo-Candle fusion v2:
# - candle-feeling-core: Core ML framework with ethical topology integration
# - niodoo-tcs: Main topological state engine with dual-mÃ¶bius-gaussian memory
# - cpp-qt-brain-integration: Qt/C++ bridge for visualization and emotional signaling
# - tensor-tools-mobius: Advanced mathematical operations for state evolution
# - gaussian-visualization-2025: 3D Gaussian sphere rendering for system states
# - claude-integration-2025: Claude-style reflections and policy reform simulations
